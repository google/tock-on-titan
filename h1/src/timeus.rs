/// Registers for a counter in the Timeus controller
///
/// The Timeus controller has four counters that can be programmed
/// independently, each with its own set of registers. Each counter tics at
/// 24Mhz. On each tic the `current_divider_value` is updated. When
/// `current_divider_value` reaches the value of `divider`, `current_value` is
/// incremented. Thus, `current_value` can be set to tick at 24Mhz by setting
/// `divider` to 1 or at a slower frequency by setting divider to a non-zero
/// value. For example, setting divider to 24 would result in a frequency of
/// 1Mhz (or one tic per microsecond). The counter continues until
/// `current_value` reaches `max_value`.
///
/// A counter can operate in one-shot or wrapping mode. In one-shot mode, the
/// counter stops when it reaches `max_value`, while in wrapping mode it
/// resets and starts counting again.
///
/// In addition to the `max_value`, each counter has a `programmed_value`. When
/// the counter reaches the `programmed_value` it generates an interrupt but
/// continues counting up to `max_value`.
