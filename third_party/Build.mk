# Note: the build for third_party/ is special, because we do not always control
# the makefiles in the directories below this. As a result, this makefile must
# interface with the build systems of third_party/*.

# We skip chromiumos-ec and libtock-c as their build systems are only designed
# to work as part of a Tock application build. We skip libtock-rs and tock as
# their target configurations are in different directories.
