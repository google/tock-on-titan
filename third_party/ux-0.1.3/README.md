# uX [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kjetilkjeka/uX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kjetilkjeka/uX) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ux.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ux)

> Non standard integer types like `u7`, `u9`, `u10`, `u63`, `i7`, `i9` etc

When non-standard-width integers is required in an application, the norm is to use a larger container and make sure the value is within range after manipulation. uX aims to take care of this once and for all by:
 - Providing `u1`-`u127` and `i1`-`i127` types that should behave as similar as possible to the built in rust types
     - The methods of the defined types are the same as for the built in types (far from all is implemented at this point but fill out an issue or create a PR if something essential for you is missing)
     - Overflow will panic in debug and wrap in release.
 - All possible lossless conversions is possible by using `From`.
 - When `TryFrom` is stabilized fallible conversions will also be supported.
